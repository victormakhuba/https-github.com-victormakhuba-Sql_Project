## COVID-19 Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on the detailed analysis of COVID-19 data to uncover insights into various aspects such as classification of cases, demographic distribution, mortality rates, resource usage, and the impact of comorbidities. The analysis is conducted using SQL to efficiently process and query large datasets, and Tableau for visualizing and deriving meaningful conclusions from the data.

## Key Findings
- Variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation were used to understand the variability in demographic counts and resource usage.
- Analysis of classification trends and demographic breakdowns across different age groups and genders.
- Insight into mortality rates segmented by gender, age groups, and comorbidities.
- Resource utilization rates (e.g., ICU and intubation) and their distribution among different demographics.
- Identification of patterns and correlations between conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases with mortality rates.

## Technologies Used
SQL Server for data storage and querying
Tableau for data visualization
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for SQL query execution and analysis
